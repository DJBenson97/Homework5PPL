    "The map[B] method in DoWith[S, A] transforms the result of the computation using a function f: A => B while leaving the state unchanged, making it useful for simple result transformations. flatMap[B] allows both the result and the state to be transformed by chaining computations through a function f: A => DoWith[S, B]. While map only modifies the result, flatMap is more flexible by enabling state and result modifications, making it useful for complex computation chains. The key difference is that map only transforms the result of the computation while keeping the state unchanged, whereas flatMap allows both the result and the state to be transformed."
